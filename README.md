_Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: The original functions I had used were long and sloppy, so I did my best to shorten them.

Summary of function(s) added: I added a function to reframe the worldcoordinates, and 3 more graphed functions.

Summary of Feature Added: I color coded each line, so distinctions between plots can now be made, and I also adjusted the axis to shift as well when the world coordinates change.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
None

## REFERENCES:

Used to find other graphable functions

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
